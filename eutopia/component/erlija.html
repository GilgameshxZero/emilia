						They had come from all over Alveria: fisherman stinking of the
						southern islands and the high officials from up north with their
						spoiled families had gathered alike here in Erlija. What made the
						World’s Exposition of 320 AD special were the guests from beyond:
						the gloomy, albino bastards from the Sovereignty, and the Felysians
						exotic in both dress and tongue. For seven days and nights, the
						streets of Erlija overflowed with food and fights and festivities
						for all. Never before had I witnessed a young man in a tailor-made
						Sovereign-wool tuxedo strike across the chess table at a brutish
						farmhand girl towering three heads above him!
					</p>
					<p>
						Look at how far Alveria’s shining jewel has fallen since then. When
						the fair ended, and all the guests returned to their former lives,
						so too did their memories of each other evaporate into
						phantasmagoria. By the time the war erupted, Erlija had already
						fallen into a state of disrepair. The crown prince had worked
						tirelessly against corruption and negligence to return Alveria’s
						glory; as thanks, they disposed of him and sent him to the
						frontlines in Felys.
					</p>
					<p>
						Head north. Last I heard, Cy had sailed with his revolutionaries
						across the high seas to ask the Sovereign for assistance. There is
						nothing more in Erlija for you, save for the golden memories of a
						sunset long past.
