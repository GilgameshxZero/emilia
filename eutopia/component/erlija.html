						They had come from all over Alveria: fisherman stinking of the
						southern islands and the high officials from up north with their
						spoiled families alike. What made the World’s Exposition of 320
						special were the guests from beyond: the gloomy, albino bastards
						from the Sovereignty, and the Felysians exotic in both dress and
						tongue. For seven days and nights, the streets of Erlija overflowed
						with food and fights and festivities for all. Never before had I
						witnessed a young man in a tailor-made Sovereign-wool tuxedo strike
						across the chess table at a brutish farmhand girl towering no less
						than three heads above him.
					</p>
					<p>
						Look around now. See how far Alveria’s shining jewel has fallen
						since then. When the fair ended, and all the guests returned to
						their former lives, so too did their memories of each other
						evaporate into phantasmagoria. By the time the inevitable war
						erupted, Erlija had already fallen into a state of disrepair. The
						crown prince Altair had worked tirelessly against corruption and
						negligence to return Alveria to its former glory; as thanks, they
						disposed of him by sending him to the frontlines in Felys.
					</p>
					<p>
						Head north. Last I heard, Cy and his revolutionaries had set sail
						toward the Sovereignty to request their assistance in the war. There
						is nothing left in Erlija for you, save for the golden memories of a
						sunset long past.
