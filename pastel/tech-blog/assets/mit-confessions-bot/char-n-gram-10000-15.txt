#4798 i feel like loneliness is killing me now. don't you know i still believe we could have found bliss together. had i been more understanding. he was freaking perfect. made everyone around me seems to care. as someone in course 6, these people don't see that as a perfectly reasonable thing to do. every waking our is torture, there is no end goal. i didn't ask you out.
i dreamed of you again last night. this time it was
a sad one. it seems i cannot get over you.

#14971 god gives me purpose. what does he expect from his fans with all of the girls. the top five guys
i've fucked have come from 6, 9, 14, 15, and 17. the most disappointing today, and i ended up spending a lot of time with this one indian freshman (at least i think she's a freshman). i don't really know how
the kids from various districts are doing against one another without being racist? why can't i be attracted to camilo until i saw him in the dt show. even
in grey sweats and a fanny pack that boy is fine.

#1321 when i was in high school and am happy that i
have the opportunity, i would treat you like them? since i don't like that this is my normal. i don't like them, but i'd feel better if i reject this person sooner rather than make her feel worse later.

#9979 i just want a man who can cuddle and talk about school and life and the cute guy that i'm crushing on in my morning class, and to have the conversation made the situation is just making me so unbearably depressed

#10578 to all the people before them who figured out stuff about viruses and nucleic acids and stuff and how far they had come from the beginning. feminism
is about empowerment, equality, and respect - you just use it as a ticket to justify cheating. that kind of bullshit is the reason facebook is here, the reason you have smartphones, and food on your table. don't like it? leave the country when you were busy and tired. its mit. i should know better. just know that ill always be there if you ever needed to measure the forces acting on a body so precisely that it was worth considering that damore's memo has been grossly missrepresented by many news outlets, i would encourage people to get people more involved; if you want to be a good ally shut the fuck up in the reading room starts smelling unbearable.

#45 sometimes i wish i could have skipped so many of the confusing parks lectures and replaced them with awesome socrate videos. sigh. maybe they'll still come in handy next fall since i'll probably be impeached because he slept with a pornstar? talk about a reality show.

#1470 every time there's a holiday break is for my mom to stay up late because of it. losing them will open room up in your life for so much more. i really
regret what happened to diversity? we don't have a memorial for daniel lewin, and mit phd student, founder of akamai, and the 1st victim of 9/11. name it the collier quadrangle or something.

#14180 the only reason i havent broken up with my girlfriend, and together they try to make me feel jealous for not having a girlfriend. i don't want to have sex with one of my good friends this semester. my
dream is to get fifty gallons of ice cream and a newborn child

#9149 stop writing confessions about tdc bullshit. mit confessions post i made a while back about him- he memorized every word. he said he wondered who it was, and had genuinely no idea it was me. if only i could answer exam questions like republican candidates answer during debates...

#14309 @8046 not even going to comment on the ultra
cruel judgement that suicide is not the right things at the right time, and not realize it too late. i wish i had a lower sex drive so i didn't have to take the chance that i can pass my probability class ---- no class can be more productive, then i will make
more money out of my money

#4451 @688 but what if you're both my achilles and my achilles heel? and what if i really was gone forever. how would my friends take it, how would my family take it, how would mit take it, how would mit take it, how would my family take it, how would mit take it, how would mit take it, how would my family take it, how would mit take it, how would people in my dorm and even on my own hall! i'm gonna shower all of them with love and support the victim without crucifying the alleged perpetrator (emphasis on "alleged"): an investigation will reveal him not to be so." sometimes there is no investigation. there wasn't with me. it was just slander. she didn't need me to be
arrested or investigated, because she wasn't actually answer their questions, will comment with such superiority and hubris that it further isolates people
with views and questions similar to those of the op, acting to further divide the student body?

#9963 what happened this year. my parents don't seem to care much about humanity. their values are very
close to only one community, not caring about the other communities- i mean, that's not an excuse to punt. maybe instead of criticizing frosh for being worried about passing...

#449 i injured my knee badly playing sports recently. my doctor advised me to take it easy for a couple
of weeks and ease back into training. i did and it felt better then i hurt it again: the same pain. i told everyone i hurt it during training, but really it's only mario kart and a couple others are the lowest-paid service employees. i don't know if i can...

#7852 i only decided to go here because im looking for real answers since i know that a lot of people i
love, but it's honestly pretty overbearing for me. i feel like they're underrepresented minorities. please remember that guy who read the bee movie script live on his facebook lmao

#4277 @7512: you have the power to make whatever decisions you like. pick something where you're okay with the outcome. don't decide based on what other people said or did. can i be your friend? i need people who care deeply about me to support the "liberal agenda." (some examples that i think are less black-and-white than liberals give them credit for: victim-blaming/safety precautions, trigger warnings) and criminal conviction without evidence ("always believe survivors"). i wish more sjws would respectfully engage with norms of democracy and human rights instead
of painting any disagreement with their ideology as
racist/sexist/etc; the political process, have never paid substantial taxes, and are willfully deluding
yourself thinly amongst the amount of people at mit
still play neopets? ..

#9519 people complain so much about every single other students in the 2pm 18.03 lecture please stop talking? i can hear you from across the world has let me down, but even more so i feel like i'm getting a pole shoved up my ass. it's just too fucking nerve-wracking.

----------------
#6820 when my friends end a call with their parents. when i was little, my parents were both raised by chain smoking parents themselves, so this to them is
very normal. what i ask my fellow student projects because you think mit will cancel the commencement speaker. it's about money, not morals.

----------------
#9496 to whoever heard it, i'm really sorry, i thought you might still dislike me and wouldn't hear because i didn't know why i was crying at first, but then i realized it was why i always felt a tug at my heart everyday knowing you'd never want to see them, even if it's a few minutes, reflecting on where i want to go for it

#11262 if you've been assaulted, call vpr. they are
genuine angels.
#2) don't trust mit police. i wish i didn't still have feelings for you for a while, but now theyre back. i couldnt help me but you have been visited by the salty spirit of singleness. loneliness and cash savings will come to you on february 14th, but only if
you post "happy singles awareness day!" in the comments what are your favorite composers and what are your favorite music pieces? and from which period (baroque, classical, romantic, modern, etc.) and from which country do you prefer classical music?

#9245 @boys: if you have to write. i can't be the only one that instantly loses all motivation to go workout, take care of yourself, and i wish i could causally call someone up just to make out and cuddle ... and have copious amounts of paper to broadcast their events, just like every single other students even if that person is not in a position to give consent to an act that, while sober, they would not have been me or any of us.
please pay attention in recitations and now i'm just pretty confused. i'm a bu stuent, so this was my first time that any guy has seen me naked. and that thought turns me on.

#3729 i don't know how to ask for it, because it's too hard to fucking wave or something?

#1548 please don't submit your confession to ask for help or encouragement to all of you: i am a potato. a fresh and delicious one! but at the same time, the last couple people i have met; i don't even know how to go about asking anyone who might be able to shed some light on open-relationships? maybe i just really hate the idea of "cheating" on someone?
