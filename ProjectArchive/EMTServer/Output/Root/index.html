    Welcome to Emilia-tan!<br />
    This is WPI website run and hosted by Gilgamesh. All requests and inquiries can be emailed to gilgamesh@tfwno.gf (yes, setting up a SMTP server on here is difficult).<br />
    <br />
    Emilia-tan is hosted on a private server, with the IP 18.96.5.88 and a connection managed by MIT IS&ampT.<br />
    Emilia-tan runs on the "Monochrome03" server, fully written in native C++ & Windows & Winsock2 API by Gilgamesh.<br />
	Being hosted on a the custom Monochrome03 server means that this version of Emilia-tan will only be online when my computer is running.<br />
    <br />
    The following button will generate a 1x1 white JPG file on the server. You can link this JPG into any email you send, and the access times to the image will be recorded on the server. Thus, you will be able to tell if your email was opened, and when it was opened.<br />
    <form action="Emilia-tan%20-%20GenSmallJPG%20(Release%20x64).exe">
        <input type="submit" value="Generate JPG!">
    </form>
    Enter below the JPG image code given to you when it was generated to obtain the access times:<br />
    <form action="window.open('Emilia-tan%20-%20GetAccessTime%20(Release%20x64).exe')">
        <input type="text" name="imagecode">
        <input type="submit" value="Get access time!">
    </form>
