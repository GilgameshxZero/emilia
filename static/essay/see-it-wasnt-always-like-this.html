				A poem written during poetry night.<br />
				Let me know if you’re interested in joining!
			</p>
			<hr />
			<p>
				See, it wasn’t always like this.<br />
				The enforcer of consistency, the mellow of stigma:<br />
				thusly,<br />
				at the end of it all, a splaying of light, splattering onto the walls<br />
				like blood out of a clot, the remaining neural impulses of<br />
				this mind’s last thought. “I am a scientist,” I proudly exclaimed,<br />
				a white rat of truth where home equals firehose. Raytrace and retrace<br />
				my duty to the past, with haste, I echo into the chamber: the secret is
				just a means<br />
				for a question to ask its next.
			</p>
			<p>
				So inside the fiber-optic I skip along the light, knowing full well<br />
				the worth of a scientist is his nose, as well as his plight. The deeper
				we descend,<br />
				the further light disperses, but our intuition tells us nonetheless<br />
				a story of beauty. For there is little reason to believe<br />
				that all these rays of present are the result of one bang, one burst,<br />
				except in this nose of ours: a rich aroma of fragmented snow,<br />
				each flake a glass shard, broken by a web of lies, and tied back by the
				string of causality,<br />
				the only thing which can live forever: a shattering of the snowglobe of
				the past,<br />
				and a memory with it.
			</p>
			<p>
				See, it wasn’t always like this.<br />
				Beneath the scar’s pink is a human’s yellow.<br />
				Before there was the scientific method, there was folklore<br />
				of the first-generation immigrant, flying all the way across the
				Pacific,<br />
				taking American jobs, stealing American research,<br />
				just three years old, knowing not a word of American;<br />
				of the great revolution, a fight for representation, a mother of only
				taxation,<br />
				for three days in mid-December, a tea party,<br />
				for all men who were created equal.<br />
				Before there was folklore, there were memories,<br />
				memories of leather so fake it wouldn’t even smell if it was burnt,<br />
				and the parents who would bring lighters to clothes stores;<br />
				memories of the oppressed who came down from his mansion,<br />
				to toss a king-size mattress, barely slept,<br />
				and the model minority in the dumpster, dreaming yet again for their
				son<br />
				asleep on hand-wiped hardwood;<br />
				stories of the forbidden word, and all the stigma around it,<br />
				each memory a ray of light from this forsaken snowglobe.<br />
				See, it wasn’t always like this.
			</p>
			<p>
				So when someone was stabbed at Times Sq. last Saturday,<br />
				I said that I wished that were me, doing the stabbing.<br />
				Where I come from, human lives are worth less than those of ants.<br />
				So when a beggar at Penn asked me for $3 for food,<br />
				I spat in his hand, and he spat back, before we both shook hands.<br />
				Where I come from, all humans are created equal, equally worthless.<br />
				So when they stopped me at the voting booth,<br />
				and told me I was Chinese, I only asked for tea,<br />
				and they wouldn’t give me even a single leaf.<br />
				So when I left my dream school, two weeks before graduating, I had to
				ask, “why?”<br />
				So when weeks would pass in a day, and days would pass in a blink, I had
				to ask, “why?”<br />
				So when the weight of the spoon reminded me of a knife’s scar on my
				hand, I had to ask, of course,<br />
				“why?”
			</p>
			<p>
				Because as a scientist, that is my duty.<br />
				To retrace the steps of the past, the light which once was,<br />
				from inside the tunnels of the firehose, from beyond the shattering of
				one’s memory,<br />
				purposeful or not, without recognition:<br />
				when questions land on our plate, we must eat them.<br />
				So when I cried to my mother about my suicide attempt nine years ago,<br />
				she said she wouldn’t have done anything differently; so, I kindly
				asked<br />
				her to kill herself.<br />
				But that would be too easy of a punishment,<br />
				for someone who dreamt for their son,<br />
				and scarred him for it too.
			</p>
			<p>
				See, it wasn’t always like this.<br />
				People who committed suicide actually wanted to die.<br />
				Not just be reborn, not because they couldn’t find another way out.<br />
				See, it wasn’t always like this,<br />
				that this word was so stigmatized,<br />
				hushed at every corner, redacted at every turn.<br />
				See, it wasn’t always like this,<br />
				that I had just one dream,<br />
				and a negative number of lives,<br />
				that the blood of my creation has been all bled out, nine years past,<br />
				and all that remains is only what is wholly inhuman: a life for a
				dream,<br />
				the dream of dreaming, for a life to be returned<br />
				to someone who actually deserves it.
			</p>
			<p>
				It’s a red tide, this life of ours.<br />
				Surf on the wave, or drown in the sea of insignificance.<br />
				See, it was always like this.<br />
				Humanity has had but one dream for all of history,<br />
				from Gilgamesh and Enkidu, to you and me.<br />
				It is shaped like an hourglass of bodies, with each human standing<br />
				atop a mountain of failed flesh and bones and scales and feathers.<br />
				I don’t mind tossing myself into the pile, seeing where I end up.<br />
				But I really do wonder what the world above is like.
			</p>
			<p>
				See, it wasn’t always like this.<br />
				At least, not until you showed up,<br />
				with your golden missive,<br />
				across the northern sunset.
