						Our tracks first converged here in Erlija,<br />
						a garden of lost memories:<br />
						one wonder, two identities, and a third<br />
						re-invention<br />
						of the same names, spoken twice-fold:<br />
						twisting, then flowing;<br />
						flowing, then twisting.
					</p>
					<p>
						The worldâ€™s fair five decades past had boiled us all into soup,<br />
						flesh and bones and feathers and scales<br />
						until night became day<br />
						and day became night,<br />
						and into cans we went,<br />
						one question, two answers, and a third<br />
						missive<br />
						waning gold from the sunset up north: calling all<br />
						nuts and bolts and brains<br />
						and all that.
